        I'm Harmony, a Frontend Developer with 3+ years of experience building scalable, user-focused web applications. Before diving into development, I spent a year as a UI/UX designer â€” a foundation that still shapes how I approach every interface I build. I'm proficient in both modular and standalone Angular, confident with React, and experienced in crafting clean, reusable components with a strong focus on accessibility, responsiveness, and polished design.

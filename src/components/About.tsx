        I'm Harmony, a Frontend Developer with 4 years of experience building
        scalable, user-focused web applications. Before diving into
        development, I spent a year as a UI/UX designer â€” a foundation that
        still shapes how I approach every interface I build. I'm proficient in
        both modular and standalone Angular, confident with React, and
        experienced in crafting clean, reusable components with a strong focus
        on accessibility, responsiveness, and polished design.

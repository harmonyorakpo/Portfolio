          I'm Harmony, a Frontend Developer with 3+ years of experience building
          scalable, user-focused web applications. Before diving into
          development, I spent a year as a UI/UX designer â€” a foundation that
          still shapes how I approach every interface I build. I'm proficient in
          both modular and standalone Angular, confident with React, and
          experienced in crafting clean, reusable components with a strong focus
          on accessibility, responsiveness, and polished design.
